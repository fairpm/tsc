## Project Roles

### Contributor

Anyone contributing in any form, including:

- Code
- Documentation
- Training materials
- Project management
- Translation
- Architecture
- Support

> Contributors to the technical project are not TSC members.

### Organizer

Contributors elevated to leadership roles:

- Modify/approve repository content
- Lead contributors or working groups

**Becoming an Organizer:**

- Requires majority approval of existing Organizers
- An existing Organizer can nominate a Contributor
- Nominee must accept nomination
- When possible, nominations are approved by [lazy consensus](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus)â€”if no objections are raised within 5 business days, the nomination moves forward
- If objections are raised, a vote will be held

**Removal:**

- Requires majority vote of existing Organizers

> Voting rights limited: related companies can only use up to **30%** of the TSCâ€™s total votes per our [Charter](charter.md).

### TSC Chairs

The TSC decides whether to have 1 or 3 chairs. They:

- Run TSC meetings
- Ensure voting process adherence
- Act as primary liaison with the governing board
- May be non-developers
- Cannot all be from the same company (if 3 co-chairs)

#### Nominations

- Nominations for TSC Chair(s) are open to all Organizers
- Interested persons may nominate themselves
- Nominations are facilitated by the Linux Foundation ([example](https://github.com/orgs/fairpm/discussions/43))

#### Term Limits and Rotation

To ensure continuity and stable leadership, Co-Chair terms are staggered as follows:

* All Co-Chair positions serve a three-year term
* To establish staggered terms:
  * The initial three Co-Chairs will serve 1-, 2-, and 3-year terms, as agreed upon among themselves
  * After the first year, one Co-Chair will rotate off and a new one will be elected annually
* This rotation helps preserve stability by ensuring:
  * Only one Co-Chair changes each year
  * At least two experienced Co-Chairs remain at all times

---

## Voting Process

- Consensus is preferred
- When necessary, TSC votes: 1 vote per member
- **Quorum**: 50% of voting members required
- **Majority vote** to pass decisions
- Asynchronous voting allowed with:
  - 50% participation
  - Clear deadline
- Unresolved issues can be escalated to the **Series Manager**
