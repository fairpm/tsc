# **FAIR Slack Community Guidelines v1.0**

The [FAIR Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fairpm/tsc/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) applies across all our community spaces, including Slack. These additional guidelines help us foster a respectful, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone.

---

## **✨ Purpose**

FAIR Slack is our primary real-time collaboration space, designed to connect contributors, share knowledge, and foster a community around FAIR. By participating here, you agree to help maintain a respectful and inclusive culture.



## **🛠 Updates to These Guidelines**

We reserve the right to update these guidelines periodically to address new scenarios or enhance clarity. When we do, we’ll communicate updates in the \#announcements channel.



## **✅ Expected Behavior**

We encourage everyone to:

* Be **kind and respectful** to all community members.
* Use inclusive language and interpret each other’s contributions generously.
* Support each other and share knowledge freely. 💪
* Celebrate each other’s milestones and contributions. 🎉 ✨ ⭐️
* Use good judgment to help maintain a constructive and welcoming environment.



## **🚫 Unacceptable Behavior**

These behaviors are not allowed and will not be tolerated:

* Threats of violence or encouragement of harm.
* Personal attacks, insults, or inflammatory remarks.
* Harassment or derogatory comments about someone’s identity or personal attributes (race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, religion, nationality, political views, etc.).
* Sharing private information without consent.
* Impersonating individuals or organizations.
* Unsolicited direct messages for promotions, services, or recruitment.
* Spamming channels or individuals.
* Abusing voice/video calling features without prior consent.
* Using emojis, GIFs, or reactions to belittle or undermine others.



## **😄 Thoughtful and Inclusive Use of Emojis**

Emojis can add warmth, clarity, and personality to our conversations. Used thoughtfully, they create a more supportive environment.

### **👍 Encouraged uses**

* Celebrating achievements and milestones: 🎉 ✨ ⭐️
* Offering encouragement and support: 💪 🙌
* Expressing gratitude: 🙏 😊
* Acknowledging agreement or appreciation: 👍 ➕ 💯
* Task management or progress: 👀 ✅ ❌  
* Kicking off a thread: 🧵  
* Pointing to a discussion: 👆👇

### **⚠️ Uses to avoid**

* Using emojis to mock, belittle, or subtly criticize others.
* Spamming emoji reactions to derail discussions.
* Using culturally ambiguous or potentially offensive symbols.
* Replacing necessary, clear feedback with emoji-only responses.
💡 **Tip:** Always start with clear words, then use emojis to add warmth, not to replace meaning.



## **💬 Emoji Requests**

We welcome suggestions for new custom emojis that can celebrate and support our community values. Please share requests in \#admin-help and explain how the emoji supports our shared culture. Admins will review all requests.



## **🤝 Respect Direct Messages & Privacy**

* Only send direct messages if the recipient has indicated they are open to them.
* Do not use DMs to promote services, events, or job opportunities.  
* Do not share private DMs without explicit consent, except in cases of harassment or code of conduct violations. 



## **📞 Voice and Video Calls**

* Always obtain permission before starting a call.
* If you start a call accidentally, apologize immediately and clarify it was unintentional.



## **💬 Keep Channels Focused**

* Keep discussions on topic and use the most appropriate channel.
* Use threads to group related messages and keep channels tidy.
* Avoid cross-posting the same message in multiple channels.
* Before starting a new topic, check for existing discussions to which you can contribute.



## **🛡 Reporting Issues & Escalation**

If you see or experience behavior that violates these guidelines or the FAIR Code of Conduct:

* Please use the ```/report-behavior command```. This will notify our slack moderators. 
* If you have a problem involving an administrator, please reach out to a different listed administrator or send an email to the Manager of LF Projects (manager@lfprojects.org).
* Your reports help us maintain a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment.



## **👥 FAIR Slack Admins**

FAIR Slack admins help maintain community safety, manage workspace settings, and resolve any issues that may arise.

* Admins will be listed in a pinned message in the \#general channel.
* Each admin’s Slack profile will include "FAIR Slack Admin" and their respective time zone.
* You can contact an admin directly via a DM or mention them in the \#admin-help channel for assistance.



## **⚖️ Consequences of Violations**

Depending on the severity, moderators may take the following actions:

* A private warning and discussion.
* Temporary suspension from Slack (e.g., 30 days).
* Permanent removal from the workspace.


## **🌟 Our Shared Responsibility**

FAIR Slack is a shared space where we build community together. Every member contributes to the tone and health of our conversations. By choosing kindness, curiosity, and empathy, we create a space where everyone feels valued and empowered to participate.
