## 🧭 Our Voice in a Nutshell

**Voice traits:**

| Trait          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Friendly**   | Write like you're helping a friend or colleague, not issuing commands.      |
| **Clear**      | Use plain language. Avoid jargon unless absolutely necessary. Remember we are a global community and not everything translates! |
| **Supportive** | Assume good intentions. Encourage contributors and users alike.             |
| **Precise**    | Accuracy is critical, especially in technical steps and code examples.      |
| **Inclusive**  | Avoid assumptions. Speak to a global, diverse, and cross-disciplinary audience. |

## 💬 Writing Style Principles

### 1. Use Plain Language

- ✅ “Click the **Submit** button to continue.”
- ❌ “Engage the user input interface and execute the form submission procedure.”

### 2. Be Direct, But Courteous

- ✅ “To start the server, run the following command.”
- ❌ “You may want to consider running the following, if you feel that’s appropriate.”

### 3. Use Active Voice

- ✅ “Install the package using the CLI.”
- ❌ “The package should be installed by the user using the CLI.”

### 4. Avoid Assumptions

The reader may be:

- New to open source  
- Unfamiliar with your environment  
- Using a screen reader  
- On a slow or unstable internet connection

## ✨ Inclusive and Welcoming Language

Our documentation should feel accessible to people of all backgrounds, levels, and abilities. Small choices in language can have a big impact on inclusion.

- **Use gender-neutral pronouns** (they/them) unless a person's pronouns are specified.
- **Avoid idioms and metaphors**—they often don’t translate well.  
  - ❌ “Hit the ground running”  
  - ✅ “Start contributing quickly”
- **Avoid gatekeeping or assumed knowledge**.  
  - ❌ “Obviously…”  
  - ❌ “Simple task…”  
  - ✅ “If you're new to this, here's where to start.”
- **Prefer inclusive technical terms** where possible:
  - ✅ “Allowlist/Blocklist” instead of “Whitelist/Blacklist”
  - ✅ “Primary/Replica” instead of “Master/Slave”

> These guidelines align with best practices for psychological safety, cultural sensitivity, and technical precision as defined by the [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org/handbook/evaluation-framework/).

## 🛠️ Technical Language

### Use code and CLI examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FAIR/your-repo-name
# Clones the repository locally
```

### Introduce new terms clearly:

- Define them the first time they’re used
- Link to helpful external references when appropriate

## 📚 Structural Tips

- **Headings**: Use a clear hierarchy (`##`, `###`, etc.)
- **Lists**: Use bullet or numbered lists for steps or options
- **Callouts**:  

  > **Note:** For helpful context  
  > **Warning:** For potential issues  
  > **Tip:** For optional but useful enhancements
---

## 🤝 Encouraging Contributions in Docs

- Reinforce that **docs are code** and just as valuable
- Invite everyone to contribute:
  - ✅ “Spotted a typo? You can fix it in a few clicks.”
  - ✅ “You don’t need to be a developer to contribute to documentation.”

## ✅ Tone in Action: Before and After

| Before                                | After                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| “You must run this or it won’t work.” | “Run this command to start the process.”               |
| “Only advanced users should try this.”| “This step requires some familiarity with Docker.”     |
| “Just clone the repo and go.”         | “Start by cloning the repository using the command below.” |

## 🧾 Final Reminders

- **Write for humans.** Then double-check for accuracy.
- **Keep docs up-to-date.** Reflect the latest changes.
- **Ask for feedback.** Collaboration improves quality.
- **Celebrate contributions.** Every fix or improvement matters.
