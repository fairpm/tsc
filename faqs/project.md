FAIR is a project under the Linux Foundation, with an [open charter with open governance](https://lfx-cdn-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/project-artifacts/fair-package-manager/fair-package-manager_Charter.pdf?v=1749049715416). Any contributor can become part of the Technical Steering Committee, and members of the TSC vote for the co-chair leadership.

## General Questions

### What does FAIR stand for?

FAIR is an acronym for "**F**ederated **a**nd **I**ndependent **R**epositories."

### Why should we trust the FAIR project?

The FAIR project's core team includes experienced and respected contributors from the broader WordPress community. FAIR is governed transparently under the Linux Foundation, with open participation and independent oversight through the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

### Has the FAIR team been sufficiently transparent?

Transparency has always been a fundamental goal. The project was initially developed privately, which is common practice to allow necessary early-stage discussions. The announcement itself has created the openness that the team has been working to create  and invites wider participation. FAIRâ€™s governance under the Linux Foundation ensures accountability.

### Why was confidentiality important in the early stages of FAIR?

Confidentiality was necessary to protect early contributors who expressed concerns about potential professional repercussions or criticism. FAIR respects contributor confidentiality, especially given past documented challenges within the WordPress community environment.

## Does it matter to users where or how they get their WordPress downloads?

It's true that many users do not actively think about where they get WordPress. As caretakers of a significant part of the web, we aim to provide secure and reliable access for them so they don't have to care, while helping developers ensure the right code rolls out. Federating the WordPress ecosystem adds redundancy and resilience.

## Will you do X, Y,or Z?

We're always happy for more community members and outside voices to suggest future paths for FAIR. If you have an idea you'd like to share, post in our [ideas forum][https://github.com/orgs/fairpm/discussions/categories/ideas].

For more information on our process, read up on our [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/fairpm/tsc).

## Code of Conduct

### Does the Code of Conduct apply to all groups?

Yes it does. No one is above the Code of Conduct.

### Why is the Code of Conduct written in legalese?

A great number of community projects use a very casual, easy to read, Code of Conduct. There's nothing wrong with that, however in order to be a part of the Linux Foundation, we were required to adopt a Code of Conduct that meets their requirements. While it does create a new hurdle for contributors, it also serves a long term benefit of demonstrating to the global open source world that we take this seriously and with the proper attention.
