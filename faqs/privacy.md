## How does FAIR impact GDPR compliance and user privacy?

FAIR is designed to improve user privacy and support GDPR compliance by reducing unnecessary tracking and central data collection. By decentralizing plugin and theme distribution, FAIR eliminates the need for centralized telemetry and analytics that can compromise user privacy. This means less personal data is collected and stored, reducing the risk of data breaches and making it easier for site owners to comply with GDPR requirements. FAIR's approach ensures that only essential, anonymized data is used, and users have greater control over their information.

## How does FAIR support compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)?

FAIR helps site owners comply with the CCPA by minimizing the collection and centralization of personal data. By reducing tracking and decentralizing plugin and theme distribution, FAIR limits the amount of user information that is collected, stored, or shared. This approach makes it easier for site owners to honor CCPA requirements, such as providing users with access to their data, supporting opt-out requests, and ensuring transparency about data usage. FAIR's privacy-first design reduces the risk of unauthorized data sharing and helps site owners meet their obligations to California residents.

## How does FAIR support compliance with the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)?

FAIR is designed to help site owners and developers meet the requirements of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) by improving software supply chain security and minimizing unnecessary data collection. By decentralizing plugin and theme distribution, FAIR reduces the risk of single points of failure and unauthorized code changes. Its privacy-first approach limits tracking and central data storage, making it easier to comply with CRA mandates for secure software development, vulnerability management, and user data protection. FAIR's architecture supports transparency, accountability, and resilience as required by the CRA.
