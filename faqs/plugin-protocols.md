## FAIR Plugin

### How do I use FAIR on my site?

Our minimum viable product (MVP) is a WordPress plugin, the FAIR Plugin. You can install it just like you would any other plugin.

You can download the latest version from the [FAIR Plugin releases page](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-plugin/releases).

### How do I add my plugin for distribution?

Right now, there is no way to add your plugins (or themes) for distribution. Our current sole distribution node is AspirePress, which is a mirror of WordPress.org's directory.

### How will this distribution work?

The [FAIR Protocol](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-protocol) is being refined, but it is based on [AtProto](https://atproto.com/) (used by BlueSky). We recommend familiarizing yourself with the documentation.


## Analytics and Telemetry

### How does FAIR affect analytics and telemetry data?

Initially, download and install stats may experience minor inaccuracies due to decentralized data gathering. This is not new, as there are already existing mirror setups at several large hosts. FAIR is actively developing solutions to consolidate and improve the reliability and transparency of telemetry data, addressing issues already present with these existing mirror setups. See the Analytics section of our protocol docs for more information.

## Reviews and Ratings

### How does FAIR handle plugin reviews and ratings?

Currently, FAIR uses existing data from WordPress.org. Future plans include exploring an open and interoperable ratings system, ensuring authenticity and reliability of reviews and ratings.
