## About the FAIR Working Group

The FAIR Team is responsible for the development and operation of The FAIR Package Manager, including server infrastructure, protocol design, and a connector plugin.

This includes the design of the decentralized protocol, design and operation of the discovery aggregator, design and operation of repository node software, and design and operation of the analytics service. These are as outlined in the previously-created Timeline and Goals document; specifically, Phase 3 (“MVP”), Phase 4 (“Distributed FAIR”), and Phase 5 (“Full FAIR”).
