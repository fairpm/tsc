The AspireCloud Working Group maintains AspireCloud, a standalone API server that bridges the legacy WordPress plugin repository and the FAIR protocol ecosystem.

This working group was formed in collaboration with [AspirePress](https://aspirepress.org), who began development of AspireCloud in October 2024—prior to the formation of the FAIR Project. Future development of certain AspirePress projects will continue under the FAIR umbrella, with original naming retained in recognition of the AspirePress team’s early work. Many of those contributors remain active within the FAIR project today.

This working group is hosted by The FAIR Package Manager for WordPress Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

We follow The FAIR Package Manager [Code of Conduct](../../code-of-conduct.md).

Organizer access to this group is granted to members of The FAIR Package Manager TSC and regular contributors to the project, as determined by The FAIR Package Manager TSC. To request access, please reach out to a TSC member.

This group welcomes contributions from any member of our community. To get started contributing, please see the contribution guide on this repo.

This Working Group is intended to be evergreen. Its scope may evolve over time to meet the needs of the project and the direction set by the TSC.
