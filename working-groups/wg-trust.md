## About the Trust Working Group

The Trust Working Group is tasked with developing the trust and moderation framework for the FAIR Package Manager for WordPress ecosystem. This includes determing the business rules and processes for labeling packages, as well as overseeing the implementation of these systems within the FAIR network.

This working group is hosted by The FAIR Package Manager for WordPress Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

We follow The FAIR Package Manager [Code of Conduct](../../code-of-conduct.md).

Organizer access to this group is granted to members of The FAIR Package Manager TSC and regular contributors to the project, as determined by The FAIR Package Manager TSC. To request access, please reach out to a TSC member.

This group welcomes contributions from any member of our community. To get started contributing, please see the contribution guide on this repo.

This Working Group is intended to be evergreen. Its scope may evolve over time to meet the needs of the project and the direction set by the TSC.
