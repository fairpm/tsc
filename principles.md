# Our Commitment to Open Source Web Publishing

We believe all users should have access to freely available, stable, and secure open source web publishing software.

We will uphold this by following these principles:

**Open Participation & Global Collaboration**

We will foster an inclusive and diverse community, with contributions from individuals and organizations worldwide.

**Do-ocracy: Decisions Are Made by Those Who Do the Work**

Our community operates as a do-ocracy -- day-to-day decisions are made by those who actively participate. Influence is earned through participation, not status or seniority.

**Transparent & Neutral Governance**

No single company, individual or entity will have outsized influence, and governance will be undertaken by a diverse set of stakeholders. Decision-making is transparent, with clear accountability mechanisms.

**Diverse Funding**

We will raise funds from across the tech community, broader enterprise, business, and open source spaces, with a diverse governance board to ensure unbiased distribution of funds.

**Intellectual Property & Process Neutrality**

The projectâ€™s intellectual property and core processes will be owned by the collective, not by any single entity, to prevent monopolization and ensure longevity.

**Development Driven by the Technical Community**

The codebase and direction will be driven by the technical steering committee, which will make decisions collectively and transparently. Decision-making processes will ensure that velocity is not blocked by excessive debate.

**Technical Excellence & Flexibility**

We maintain a lean and efficient core that allows for easy extensibility in any direction.  The distribution will remain aligned with WordPress core, and canonical plugins will be developed based on widespread need.

**Security and Resilience as a Priority**

We will prioritise security in the codebase, in the supply chain, and in our governance and operations. We will meet industry and regulatory standards and strive to keep the open web secure.

**Sustainable Open Source**

We ensure long-term sustainability by balancing free access to stable web-publishing software  with a responsible funding and governance model.

**Decentralized & Federated Infrastructure**

Community assets and repositories will be maintained as a decentralized, federated system to prevent single points of failure. This ensures resilience, redundancy, and broad participation.
